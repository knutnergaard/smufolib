SMufoLib: Where SMuFL meets UFO
===============================

SMufoLib is a small Python library designed to aid in font development
and scripting specific to the `Standard Music Font Layout
<https://w3c.github.io/smufl/latest/>`_ (SMuFL). As an extension of the
`FontParts <https://fontparts.robotools.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_
API, SMufoLib relies on the platform and application independent
`Unified Font Object <https://unifiedfontobject.org>`_ (UFO) format and
the command line, rather than any particular font editor.
